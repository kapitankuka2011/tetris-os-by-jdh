# Tetris-OS
a fork of deleted jdh's tetris os and with fixed error sb16
enjoy!<br><br>
if you are jdh and you wonder why theres no sound then heres why<br>
- Pulseaudio is not a thing on linux (and windows i think)
- if theres no pulseaudio then sb16 will not work so there will be a error and most people are on windows so they cannot compile (when i was using windows wsl did not work)
